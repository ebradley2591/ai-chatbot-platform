## üéØ Client Acquisition Scripts

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: 24/7 Customer Support for [Business Name] - No Additional Staff Needed

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have 24/7 customer support, which means you're likely missing leads and customer inquiries outside business hours.

I've helped [similar business] increase their customer inquiries by 40% using an AI chatbot that:
- Answers questions 24/7
- Books appointments automatically
- Qualifies leads before they reach you
- Costs less than hiring a part-time employee

Would you be interested in a 2-minute demo to see how this could work for your business?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
